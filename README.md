# Library
This is the **Library** project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), 
<br>where I built a simple library management system using 
<br>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases my skills in 
<br>front-end development, focusing on interactive UI elements and 
<br>utilizing JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

**Features:**
<br>Users can add, remove, and display books in a personal library.
<br>Each book contains attributes like title, author, and read status.
<br>The project demonstrates the use of event listeners, form handling, 
<br>and dynamic updates to the page content.

**Technologies Used:**
<br>HTML for the structure
<br>CSS for styling
<br>JavaScript for functionality (DOM manipulation and event handling)
