# Library
This is the Library project from The Odin Project, 
where I built a simple library management system using 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases my skills in 
front-end development, focusing on interactive UI elements and 
utilizing JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

Features:
Users can add, remove, and display books in a personal library.
Each book contains attributes like title, author, and read status.
The project demonstrates the use of event listeners, form handling, and dynamic updates to the page content.

Technologies Used:
HTML for the structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for functionality (DOM manipulation and event handling)

Feel free to check out the code and provide feedback
